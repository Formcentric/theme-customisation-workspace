# Theme Structure

A typical theme consists of the following key files and directories:

## Core Files

```
themes/[theme-name]/
├── _variables.json     # Defines theme-specific variables
├── definition.json     # Sets theme configuration and parameters
├── script.js           # Imports all template functions from templates/
├── styles.scss         # Imports all partials from partials/
├── fonts/              # Includes font files
├── img/                # Includes theme images
├── partials/           # Includes SCSS style components
├── templates/          # Includes template files
└── variables/          # Defines theme-specific variables
```

## Key Components

1. **\_variables.json**

    - Contains theme-specific default values as css variables that are programmatically injected into the form during runtime
    - Defines core styling variables like:
    - Colors (primary, secondary, text, etc.)
    - Typography (font family, sizes)
    - Spacing and layout values
    - Component-specific settings

2. **definition.json (Formcentric Cloud)**

    - Defines theme metadata, parameters, and configuration
    - Specifies customizable options such as colors, fonts, and spacing
    - Configures language-specific labels and descriptions
    - Lists required assets

3. **script.js**

    - Entry point for template functions
    - Contains import statements for all template functions
    - When building themes, the script is compiled into a single file and added to the form during runtime

4. **styles.scss**

    - Entry point for styles
    - Contains import statements for all partials
    - When building the theme, the styles are compiled into a single file and added to the form during runtime
    - Optionally, the SCSS file can be added directly as an import to the stylesheet of the embedding application

5. **partials/**

    - Contains modular SCSS files for form components
    - Imported by styles.scss

6. **templates/**

    - Contains template files for form components
    - Imported by script.js

7. **variables/**
    - Contains variable files for form components:
        - **\_fc-variables.scss**
            - Variable configuration file of the theme
            - Determines if theme variables have already been declared during build time (see \_variables.scss) and otherwise defaults to css variables injected during runtime (see \_variables.json)
        - **\_variables.scss**
            - SCSS variables containing the same values as \_variables.json
            - Not included in styles.scss by default
            - Must be added to styles.scss to use it instead of injected css variables from \_variables.json in the css output file
