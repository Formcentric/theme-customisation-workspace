# Customization

There are three main ways to customize a theme:

## CSS Variables

One of the best ways to start customizing is to tweak the CSS variables located in `_variables.json`. If you want to create new variables to use in your SCSS, you need to add them in `./variables/_fc-variables.scss`.

**NOTE:** While changes to the file above are sufficient for the development server, if your target environment is CoreMedia, you must also adjust the variables in `_variables.scss`.

## SCSS Partials

For more specific style changes, adjust the SCSS files located in `/partials`. You can modify existing partial files or add your own. When adding a new partial, import it in the `styles.scss` file (root folder).

## JavaScript Templates

The HTML markup is written in JavaScript templates inside the `/templates` folder. Templates are functions that return HTML. They are called by the form app and receive specific props that vary depending on the form element.
