# Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with the Formcentric Theme Customisation Workspace:

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) are installed on your system:

```bash
# Node
node -v

# pnpm
pnpm -v
```

Check `.nvmrc` file to identify the recommended Node.js version. Install this version if
needed and then execute the following commands:

- `corepack enable` to activate Corepack
- `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` to set up pnpm

Then execute the following commands to set up your development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start development server
pnpm dev-cloud   # For Formcentric Cloud users
# or
pnpm dev-local   # For self-hosted users
```

Once the development server is running you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
Make sure you use the correct command, depending on whether youâ€™re using Formcentric
Cloud or a self-hosted Formcentric headless server.

For other configuration options and next steps, please see the instructions for [usage](/docs/en-getting-started-usage--docs) and
[configuration](/docs/en-getting-started-configuration--docs).
