# Usage

<br />

## For Formcentric Cloud users

```bash
pnpm dev-cloud
```

### Switch forms

You can use the drop-down menu in the sidebar to change the preview form.
If you want to try out your design with your own form, then you will need to edit the file
`./config/cloudConfig.json`.
The fcForms array specifies the forms that appear in the drop-down.

```json
{
    "id":  "<form-embed-id>", // See screenshot below
    "name": "Contact form" // Name shown in the form drop-down
},
```

<img
    src='./assets/embed-id.png'
    alt='finding a form embed-id in the fc-cloud'
    width='800'
/>

## For self-hosted users

Make sure that the URL of your headless server matches the URL predefined in the
`./config/localConfig.json` file (http://localhost:8080).
If necessary, adjust to match.

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev-local
```

Specify your form definition. You do this either by
– adding the definition into the input field on the user interface
– or changing the `formDefinition` property in `./config/localConfig.json`
