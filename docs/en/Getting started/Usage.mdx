# Usage

<br />

## For FC Cloud Users

```bash
pnpm dev-cloud
```

### Changing Forms

You can change the preview form using the dropdown in the sidebar.
If you need to test your design with a custom form, update the `./config/cloudConfig.json` file.
The fcForms array determines which forms appear in the sidebar dropdown.

```json
{
    "id":  "<form-embed-id>", // See the screenshot below
    "name": "Contact form" // Display name used in the form dropdown
},
```

<img
    src='./assets/embed-id.png'
    alt='finding a form embed-id in the fc-cloud'
    width='800'
/>

## For Self-hosted Users

Verify that the URL of your headless-server matches the predefined URL in `./config/localConfig.json` (http://localhost:8080) and update it if needed.

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev-local
```

Set your form definition by either: - Pasting it inside the input field of our user interface - Updating the `formDefinition` property in `./config/localConfig.json`
