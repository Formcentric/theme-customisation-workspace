# Theme structure

A typical theme consists of the following core files and directories:

## Core files

```
themes/[theme-name]/
├── _variables.json     # Defines theme-specific variables
├── definition.json     # Configures the theme and its parameters
├── script.js           # Imports all template functions from templates/
├── styles.scss         # Imports all partials from partials/
├── fonts/              # Contains fonts
├── img/                # Contains images
├── partials/           # Contains SCSS components for styling
├── templates/          # Contains template files
└── variables/          # Defines theme-specific variables
```

## Core components

1. **_variables.json**
    - Contains theme-specific default values as CSS variables, which are injected programmatically into the form at runtime
    - Defines basic styling variables, such as:
        - Colours (primary colour, secondary colour, text, etc.)
        - Typography (font families, sizes)
        - Spacings and layout values
        - Component-specific settings

2. **definition.json (Formcentric Cloud)**
    - Defines theme metadata, parameters and configuration
    - Specifies customisable options such as colours, fonts and spacings
    - Configures language-specific labels and descriptions
    - Lists required assets

3. **script.js**
    - Entry point for template functions
    - Contains import instructions for all template functions
    - When the theme is built, this script is packaged into an individual file and added to the form at runtime

4. **styles.scss**
    - Entry point for styles
    - Contains import instructions for all partials
    - When the theme is built, the file is compiled into an individual CSS file and added to the form at runtime
    - Optionally, the SCSS file can be imported directly into the style sheet of the embedding application

5. **partials/**
    - Contains modular SCSS files for form components
    - Is imported by `styles.scss`

6. **templates/**
    - Contains template files for form components
    - Is imported by `script.js`

7. **variables/**
    - Contains variable files for form components:
        - **_fc-variables.scss**
            - Core configuration file for theme variables
            - During the build, checks whether variables have already been declared (see `_variables.scss`)
            - Otherwise, uses the CSS variables from `_variables.json` injected at runtime
        - **_variables.scss**
            - SCSS variables with identical values to `_variables.json`
            - Is not imported by default into `styles.scss`
            - Must be imported manually, so as to be used instead of the CSS variables from `_variables.json`
