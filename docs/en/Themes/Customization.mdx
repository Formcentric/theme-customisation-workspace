# Customisation

There are three main ways to customise a theme:

## CSS variables

The quickest way to customise a theme is to change CSS variables or add new ones. These control colours, typography and spacing, for example, as well as other design tokens.

### Change existing variables

Depending on the target environment, you will need to change values in various places.

#### Development

During development, you can change the values in the `_variables.json` file. Your changes are immediately visible.

#### Formcentric Cloud

In Formcentric Cloud, apart from making adjustments in `_variables.json`, you will also need to adjust the corresponding design parameters in the `definition.json` file.

**Please note:**<br />
The variables defined in definition.json must also be available as CSS variables in the final CSS output for the theme.


#### Embedding in an application using SCSS

If you embed the theme in an application that supports SCSS, you can adjust the variables directly within `_variables.scss`.

**Please note:**  
By default, `_variables.scss` is not imported automatically into `styles.scss`.  
Accordingly, add it manually as the first line above `_fc-variables.scss`:

```scss
@import './variables/_variables';
@import './variables/_fc-variables';
```

### Add new variables

You can also add your own variables. When doing so, you must ensure that the variable is correctly included in `_fc-variables.scss`.

1. Add the variable to `_variables.scss`.
2. Edit `_variables.json` to include the variable.
3. In `definition.json`, enter the variable as a new design parameter (relevant only for Formcentric Cloud).
4. Edit the file `_fc-variables.scss` to include the variable.


#### Example:

##### `_variables.scss`

```scss
$scrollbarWidth: 10px;
// Colours with the suffix Val enable later rgba parsing (see `_fc-variables.scss`)
$newColorVal: #000;
```

##### `_variables.json`

```json
{
    "scrollBarWidth": "10px",
    "newColor": "#000"
}
```

##### `definition.json`

```json
{
  "type": "TEXT",
  "required": false,
  "labels": { "en": "Scrollbar width" },
  "name": "scrollbarWidth",
  "value": "10px"
}

{
    "type": "COLOR",
    "required": false,
    "labels": { "en": "New color" },
    "name": "newColor",
    "value": "#000"
}
```

##### `_fc-variables.scss`

```scss
$scrollbarWidth: var(--scrollbarWidth) !default;
// If available, uses existing variables from `_variables.scss`, otherwise from `_variables.json`
$newColorVal: var(--newColor) !default;

// Implements rgba parsing for colour variables
$newColor: rgba($newColorVal, 1);
```

## Template customisation

### Extended Formcentric theme

If you use an extended FC theme, you can override individual templates while inheriting the rest from the base theme. Proceed as follows:

1. Create the template file you want to use in the appropriate directory structure of your theme
2. Export the function using the same name as in the base template (for details, see the index.js files for filenames and exports)

**Example:**
To override the template for `emailField`:

```javascript
export const emailField = (html, props) => html`<input type="email" />`
```

The form will now use your user-defined emailField template instead of the version from the base theme, while all other templates are retained from the base theme.

### Full Formcentric theme

A full FC theme is a complete copy of a Formcentric theme, including all of its templates and components.  
To customise specific parts of the theme, you simply open the corresponding file and edit these directly.

### Custom theme

A custom theme contains only the underlying theme boilerplate.  
You will need to add your own versions of all templates manually here.

## Best Practices

1. Start with CSS variables for simple customisation work
2. Make use of SCSS partials for component-specific styles
3. Override templates only when it is absolutely necessary
4. Make sure to follow accessibility rules in your own templates
5. Test to confirm responsive behaviour across various breakpoints
