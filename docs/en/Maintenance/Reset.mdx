# Reset Workspace

You can use the reset command to clean up your workspace, as follows:
- Remove all user-defined themes
- Empty the directory for base themes
- Retain important .gitkeep files
- Re-install dependences

To reset the workspace, execute the following command:


```bash
pnpm reset
```

You are prompted to confirm the reset before the reset is carried out.

## What will be reset?

You can define the files and directories affected by configuring these in the file `formcentric.config.js` (see [reset configuration](/docs/en-getting-started-configuration--docs#reset-configuration)).

## After a reset

After executing the reset command:

1. The workspace is reset to its original state
2. All dependencies are reinstalled automatically
3. You can immediately start work on creating new themes
