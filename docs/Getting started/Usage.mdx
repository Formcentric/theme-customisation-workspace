# Usage

## For FC Cloud Users

```bash
pnpm dev-cloud
```

### Changing Forms

You can change the preview form by using the dropdown in the sidebar. If you need to test your design with your custom form you can by adjusting the `./config/cloudConfig.json` file. The `fcForms` array determines which forms will be rendered in the sidebar dropdown.

```json
{
    "id":  "<form-embed-id>", // see the screenshot below
    "name": "Contact form" // this is used by the dropdown as a display name
},
```

## For Self-hosted Users

1. Check if the URL of your headless-server matches the predefined URL in `./config/localConfig.json` (http://localhost:8080) and adjust it if needed.

2. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev-local
```

3. Set your form definition either in `./config/localConfig.json` or paste it inside the input field of our user interface.
