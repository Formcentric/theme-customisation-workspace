# Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with the Formcentric Theme Customization Workspace:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your system:

```bash
# Node
node -v

# pnpm
pnpm -v
```
Check `.nvmrc` for the recommended Node.js version. Install it if needed, then:
- Run `corepack enable` to enable Corepack
- Run `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` to set up pnpm

2. Run the following commands to set up your development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start development server
pnpm dev-cloud   # For FC Cloud users
# or
pnpm dev-local   # For self-hosted users
```

Once the development server is running, access the application at `http://localhost:3000Â´. 
Use the appropriate command depending on whether you are using FC Cloud or self-hosting the Formcentric Headless Server.
