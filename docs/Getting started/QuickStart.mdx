# Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with the Formcentric Theme Customization Workspace:

1. First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed on your system.

2. Run the following commands to set up your development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start development server
pnpm dev-cloud   # For FC Cloud users
# or
pnpm dev-local   # For self-hosted users
```

After starting the development server, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. Choose the appropriate command based on whether you're using FC Cloud or self-hosting Formcentric Headless Server.

For detailed configuration options and next steps, see the [Usage](/docs/getting-started-usage--docs) and [Configuration](/docs/getting-started-configuration--docs) guides.
