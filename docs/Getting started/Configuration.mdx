## Cloud Configuration

The cloud configuration file manages settings for FC Cloud users running `pnpm dev-cloud`. Specifically, which forms are available to test themes against.

## Local Configuration

The local configuration file manages settings for self-hosted users running `pnpm dev-local`. Specifically, the headless server url and the form definition to use for testing.

## Workspace Configuration

The workspace configuration file manages your theming environment, handling file paths, theme variants, and build settings.

### Overview

Your workspace configuration lives in `config/formcentric.config.js.ts` and defines how your theming system behaves. Let's break down each section:

### Path Configuration

The `paths` object defines all important directories and files in your workspace:

```ts
paths: {
    rootPath: '.',
    configPath: 'config/cli.config.tson',
    moduelPath: 'node_modules/@formcentric/client/dist/themes',
    basePath: 'src/themes-base',
    targetPath: 'src/themes',
    utilsPath: 'node_modules/@formcentric/client/dist/themes/utils',
    prettierConfigPath: '.prettierrc',
    output: 'dist',
}
```

### Variant Configuration

The `variants` object defines how specific files in extended Formcentric themes will be read, merged and written during the build process:

```ts
variants: {
    files: [],
}
```

### Reset Configuration

The `reset` object defines the files and directories that will be affected by the reset command:

```ts
reset: {
    files: [],
}
```
