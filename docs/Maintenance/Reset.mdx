# Reset Workspace

The reset command helps you clean up your workspace by:

- Removing all custom themes
- Clearing the base themes directory
- Preserving essential `.gitkeep` files
- Reinstalling dependencies

To reset the workspace:

```bash
pnpm reset
```

You will be prompted to confirm before proceeding with the reset operation.

## What Gets Reset

The files and directories that will be affected can be configured in the `formcentric.config.js.ts` file (see [Reset Configuration](/docs/getting-started-configuration--docs#reset-configuration)).

## After Reset

After running the reset command:

1. The workspace will be restored to its initial state
2. Dependencies will be automatically reinstalled
3. You can start creating new themes from scratch
